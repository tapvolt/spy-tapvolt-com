This method works on both Mac and Windows computers, and supports both video and audio. On Windows, this requires the installation of <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">QuickTime</a>.</p><p><strong>Server-push JPEG</strong><br>  This is a widely-compatible format that works well on local networks and requires very little server resources. For streaming over the internet however, the MPEG-4 format will give better performance. This method is supported by all major web browsers on both Mac and Windows computers (except Internet Explorer), as well as iOS devices. This method does not support audio.</p><p><strong>JavaScript JPEG</strong><br>  This works by using a scripting language called JavaScript to cause the browser to continuously download and display images. This is useful for certain mobile devices which do not support the methods above.</p><p><strong>Still image JPEG</strong><br>  A still image will be displayed for each camera. To refresh the display with   new images, press the browser's reload button.</p><p><strong>Auto</strong><br>  An appropriate method will be chosen automatically depending on the browser   that you are using.</p><hr><p><strong>*</strong> If you cannot view the MPEG-4 stream, it is most likely due to the QuickTime settings on your computer. Please do the following:<br><ul><li><p><strong>Mac</strong><br>Open the Terminal application from your Utilities folder (which you can locate using the Finder's Go menu), and enter the following line of text, followed by the return key:<br><br>qtdefaults write TransportSettings HTTP 80<br><br><img src="qtterminal.png" width="474" height="130"></p></li>	<li><p><strong>Windows</strong><br>Go to the Control Panel and double-click on QuickTime to open the QuickTime settings. Click the Advanced tab, change the Transport Setup to Custom, and then select HTTP and Port 80 in the subsequent window:<br><br><img src="qtwindows.png" width="416" height="297"></p></li></ul></p></body></html>
